## Manuscripts from members of the ZIBRA consortium

### <a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/049916v1">Discovery of a persistent Zika virus lineage in Bahia, Brazil</a>

_Preprint in bioRxiv_

This study from ZiBRA consortium members Nuno Faria and Oli Pybus show that samples from Bahia in Brazil, the area with the largest number of cases of microencephaly form a distinct clade and are closely related. Notably this paper demonstrates Zika genome recovery from clinical samples using bait probes and sequencing on Illumina. Whole genome recovery is tricky due to high Ct values.
