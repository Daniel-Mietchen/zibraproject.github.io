## Manuscripts from members of the ZIBRA consortium

Discovery of a persistent Zika virus lineage in Bahia, Brazil

http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/049916v1

From members of the ZiBRA consortium this paper demonstrates genome recovery from
clinical samples using bait probes, however genome recovery is quite poor. Samples
from Bahia are very closely related, adding weight to evidence that Zika was
introduced into Brazil in mid-2014.
