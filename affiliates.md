## Affiliates

We are proud to be working with some super cool people:

### Nextstrain

The <a href="http://zika.nextstrain.org">zika.nextstrain.org</a> website provides
a dynamic visualisation of the Zika public sequences posted so far. This website
is made by the excellent Trevor Bedford and Richard Neher.


### Virological.org

The <a href="http://Virological.org">virological</a> web forum is a place to
discuss genome sequencing in viral epidemics. We will post updates to this website.


## Things we like

Zika research is happening in the open, here are some useful online resources:

###Zika Open

The Zika Open website.

### The O'Connor website

The O'Connor group are publishing in real time their findings on Zika virus.

### Preprints

Zika publications are increasingly being seen on bioRxiv as a way to rapidly
disseminate findings. We are committing to the use of bioRxiv, and there
is a nice way to find Zika manuscripts through the AcademicKarma website.
