## Affiliates

We are proud to be working with some super cool people:

### Nextstrain

The <a href="http://nextstrain.org/zika/">nextstrain</a> website provides
a dynamic visualisation of the Zika public sequences posted so far. This website
is made by the excellent Trevor Bedford and Richard Neher.


### Virological.org

The <a href="http://Virological.org">virological</a> web forum is a place to
discuss genome sequencing in viral epidemics. We will post updates to this website.


## Things we like

Zika research is happening in the open, here are some useful online resources:

### Zika Open

The <a href="http://www.who.int/bulletin/online_first/zika_open/en/">Zika Open</a> website
run by the World Health Organization tracks open resources published in their Bulletin.

### The O'Connor website

Dave O'Connor's group at UW-Madison are publishing in real time their findings on Zika virus
via the <a href="https://zika.labkey.com/project/home/begin.view?">Zika LabKey</A> website.

### Preprints

Zika publications are increasingly being seen on <a href="http://www.biorxiv.org">bioRxiv</a>
as a way to rapidly disseminate findings. We are committing to the use of bioRxiv, and there
is a nice way to find Zika manuscripts through the Zika channel on the
<a href="http://academickarma.org/theme/zika">AcademicKarma</a> website.

## Acknowledgements
