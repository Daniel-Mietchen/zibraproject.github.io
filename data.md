## Sequencing data

We have an open data release policy and links to datasets will be made available
as soon as we produce them.

### Validation data

We have sequenced the MP1751 strain of Zika virus. This virus was
originally described by Haddow [1] and has undergone several rounds
of passage. This work was performed in collaboration with
Public Health England.

  - MP1751 (R9 pore) <a href="http://s3.climb.ac.uk/nanopore/Zika_MP1751_PHE_Long_R9_2D.tgz">47.9gb</a> (note this is a tar file, extract with ``tar -x``).
