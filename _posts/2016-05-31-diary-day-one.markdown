It wouldn't be a sequencing trip without some frantic last minute packing
from Josh.  This time he stole Tim's pipettes and left the heat sealer on
- sorry to the guys back home.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Last minute packing, yesterday <a href="https://t.co/NDZ1iDwgVB">pic.twitter.com/NDZ1iDwgVB</a></p>&mdash; Nick Loman (@zibraproject) <a href="https://twitter.com/zibraproject/status/737744568494522372">May 31, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Unlike last time, armed with official paper work, we were <a href="/blog/josh-visit-to-brazil/">spared the ordeal of
a long delay in customs</a> on arrival in São Paulo (wow, took me about 5 minutes to figure
out how to wrote São Paulo - it's option-n a for those with Macs). However
at Birmingham Josh nearly caused an international incident with the powdered
cranberry herbal remedy he was bringing for Charlys' dog, which earned him
an explosives check.

The 15-hour journey on the impressive 747-8i, via Frankfurt, passed uneventfully
other than a night's worth of elbow tennis and heavy snoring from my travel companion. 

On arrival after a restorative _lingua_ and a few cheese balls at the airport,
we endured 2 hours of some of the worst traffic I've ever seen as we navigated
into São Paulo's epic sprawl. It is home to 18 million.

After another coffee Josh was straight in the lab, trying to put the finishing
touches to his multiplexing protocol, either the stuff of genius or the stuff
of madness on little sleep:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not sure Josh should be allowed to design Zika amplicon multiplexing experiments after a 15h flight <a href="https://twitter.com/zibraproject">@zibraproject</a> <a href="https://t.co/1hcJlO2qI9">pic.twitter.com/1hcJlO2qI9</a></p>&mdash; Nick Loman (@pathogenomenick) <a href="https://twitter.com/pathogenomenick/status/737715726522429440">May 31, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

(We need a multiplexing protocol to reduce the number of pipetting steps
per sample, and to minimise chances of cross-sample mixups and contamination.
We'll <a href="/blog/multiplex-pcr-protocol/">post the protocol</>
as we improve it.).

I've been busy building a virtual machine image that we can roll out to the
three laptops. We will be attempting offline basecalling with the ``nanonet``
software, so that we can perform real-time run assessment without a fast
Internet connection. The multiplexing and barcode scheme means we need to have
immediate feedback on how well sample preparation is working, rather than
waiting for Metrichor 2D basecalling.

More on this in another post.

Nuno's been finishing his fellowship application, which is a week overdue.

Our gracious host, Dr. Ester Sabino, head of the Instituto de Medicina Tropical
at the Universidade de S-option n a-o Paulo took us for lunch (steak, of course)
and then recommended an amazing churascaria for dinner:
